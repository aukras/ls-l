An implementation of the utility function "ls -l". This version varries slightly. Does not support filename expression matching (Globbing), colour coding and only works for specified directories. Use Python 3.10.

Usage:
```
python3 ls.py <directory>
```

Only valid directories are accepted as command line arguments. If no directory is given, a current working directory will be used.
